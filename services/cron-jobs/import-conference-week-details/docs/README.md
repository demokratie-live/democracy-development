- Data flow sequences
- Deployment strategies
- Error handling flows
- Component relationships

These diagrams are rendered automatically in GitHub and most modern documentation viewers.

## Contributing to Documentation

When updating the service, please ensure corresponding documentation updates:

1. **Architecture changes**: Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` with new components or relationships
2. **Data flow changes**: Update `DATA_FLOW.md` with new processing steps
3. **Deployment changes**: Update `DEPLOYMENT.md` with new configuration or procedures
4. **API changes**: Update `API.md` with new interfaces or data structures

## Documentation Standards

- Use Mermaid diagrams for visual representations
